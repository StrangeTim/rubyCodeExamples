Word Count Finder

The word count finder app will find a input word within an input test phrase.
It then displays the number of times the word appears in the phrase.
This version of the program will only test english alphabetic characters.  Any
non-alphabetic characters are removed before comparing the input word to the
test phrase.

Installation requires Ruby and the sinatra gem.  The test spec files also require
the installation of the rspec and capybara gems.

The app has been deployed to the web with Heroku at the url:
